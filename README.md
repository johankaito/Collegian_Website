# Collegian_Website

####Changes made
- Froze navigation bar on scroll.
- Changed font 
- Added logo to Navbar
- Added search tab to navbar

####Here is what we still have left:
- Make email subscriptions the first thing that pops up
- Moving the buttons about twitter, facebook, etc to the top. On that
note, the RSS feed and email buttons in this collection do not work (I
was thinking of putting these right after the search once font is
reduced)
- Change the font, reduce the size of the font, and change the
background
